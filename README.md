# Import Roblox Studio Themes
</div>

Small utility plugin for Figma to import the latest Roblox Studio theme data as Colour Styles directly into Figma.

<font color="grey">

**Disclaimer:** Figma plugins are hard! This is in no way optimised or "well-coded." This plugin was intended for personal use, and did the job.
</font>

## How it Works
Roblox Studio is not required for this plugin to work&mdash;It's all contained inside Figma! The plugin will download the latest theme data from [**@CloneTrooper1019/Roblox-Client-Tracker**][roblox client tracker], converts the Hex values over to a Figma-specific RGB type, and sets (or updates existing) the Colour Styles in the active project.

## Installation
* Download from the [Figma Community page][download] (pending review)
* Clone this repo and load the plugin locally in the desktop app
